                        Hi, my name is <strong>Seamus Connolly</strong>, and I am an freshmen computer science student.
                        I'm from <em>Alameda, California</em> which is in the Bay Area. Some of my hobbies 
                        include reading, playing soccer, learning new skills, and going to the gym. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy coding and want to join Hack4Impact to gain further experience and be able 
                        to actually help people with my code. 
                    </p>
